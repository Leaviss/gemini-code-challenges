## Day 2: The Gatekeeper (Conditionals)

**The Goal:**
Create a security checkpoint script to practice `if`, `else if`, and `else` logic.

**Requirements:**
1. Prompt the user to enter their **role** (string).
2. Compare the input against known roles:
   - "admin" -> Print "Full Access Granted"
   - "manager" -> Print "Limited Access Granted"
   - Any other input -> Print "Access Denied"

**Example Output:**
```text
Enter your role: guest
Access Denied
