## Day 3: The Persistent Bot (Loops)

**The Goal:**
Create a simple authentication loop to learn how Go handles iteration.

**Requirements:**
1. Define a hardcoded secret password.
2. Continuously prompt the user to enter the password.
3. If the input is incorrect, print "Try again" and loop back.
4. If the input is correct, print "Access Granted" and terminate.

**Example Output:**
```text
Enter password: password
Incorrect, try again.
Enter password: guest
Incorrect, try again.
Enter password: secret123
Access Granted!
